# EDA-In-Python
EDA referes to exploratory Data Analysis this involves various steps in order to preprocess the dataset to make suitable for training any machine learning algorithm.
i choose an IBM dataset of 1470 records having 35 features in each. this data set contain information about employees and their attirition,I have applied logistic regression model on dataset to predict whether a current working employee going for attrition or not. 
check for null values in dataset and handle it
check for scale range in each feature and handle it accordingly
used Labelencoding to handle categorical data
check for imbalanced classs and handled it using SMOTE
used StandardScaler for standardizing feature values after train test split
used PCA for Dimensionality reduction
applied logisticregression model on data to differentiate how scaling and PCA affect the accuracy of model.
